    <h1>Vote Labor!</h1>
    <p>The <b>UTD Labor Ticket</b> is a diverse coalition of students committed to <span class="underline">labor rights, transparency, and student engagement.</span> We think that too often, the most disadvantaged students at UTD are given the least representation in campus leadership positions. We want to hold UTD accountable for the mistreatment of student workers (especially international students) and advocate for a less opaque administration. We're fighting to build a UTD that is more ethical, sustainable, and inclusive. <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/erdbM3qNqmCbbacx2">Join us!</a></p>
    <p class="vote button">Vote <b>Ayoub Mohammed</b> this Wednesday!</a>
    <h2>The Presidential Runoff Election</h2>
    <p>
      Since the presidential election was so close, there is a runoff election this Wednesday, 4/3. To support the Labor ticket in the runoff, vote for <span class="name">Ayoub Mohammed</span> using the link in your UTD email. We came within 6 votes of beating Ignite in the last election, so every vote counts this Wednesday!<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Student Workers and Chartwells</h2>
    <p>We are deeply concerned by reports that Chartwells, UTD's food service contractor, is mistreating and taking advantage of student workers. For too long, student government and campus administration has brushed aside allegations of harassment, wage withholding, and mismanagement. As reported in <a href="https://utdmercury.com/chartwells-workers-move-to-unionize/">The Mercury</a>, Chartwells encourages managers to prey on the most vulnerable student population, international students. Furthermore, Chartwells <a href="https://utdmercury.com/chartwells-workers-allege-lack-of-food-safety-training/">does not properly train employees</a> or correctly <a href="https://utdmercury.com/food-service-workers-accuse-chartwells-management-of-misconduct/">handle allegations of harassment.</a> If elected, we will fight for a full, independent investigation into Chartwells, and lobby the UTD administration to switch to a more responsible food service contractor.
    <h2>Transparency & Engagement</h2>
    <p>We believe student government, and the UTD administration in general, should be transparent, open, and accessible. We believe that instead of allowing subcontractors to <a href="https://utdmercury.com/chartwells-officials-deny-worker-allegations/">investigate themseleves when grievances arise</a>, UTD should conduct independent audits and make them publicly available. We will fight to make student government more accessible to the general student body by building a strong online presence for it.</p>
